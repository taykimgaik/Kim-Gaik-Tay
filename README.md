The project focuses on classifying skin disease images into four classes using transfer learning with the InceptionV3 pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN). It includes a comparison between a single data split with a ratio of 0.8:0.1:0.1 and a nested 5-fold cross-validation approach, as well as the development of a web application for childcare use.
This code is provided to enhance transparency and reproducibility in response to reviewer comments.

# A Skin Disease Identification Using CNNs for Childcare Applications

The project focuses on classifying skin disease images into four classes using transfer learning with the InceptionV3 pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN). It includes a comparison between a single data split with a ratio of 0.8:0.1:0.1 and a nested 5-fold cross-validation approach, as well as the development of a web application for childcare use.
